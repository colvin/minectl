this is the installer for the minectl script.

minectl is a script written in bash to manage Minecraft servers.

minectl was written on FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE, specifically for the
 FreeBSD platform. at the moment, minectl will only work on FreeBSD.
 later releases may include support for GNU/Linux or other UNIX-type
 systems.

the minectl script can create, destroy, start, stop, and restart
 Minecraft servers, running them as an unprivileged user. it can
 also create backups, offer a command console, update server
 java jar archive versions, and (if enabled and correctly set up)
 use the Minecraft-Overviewer program to generate web-viewable
 maps of your world. it also includes a daemon, minectld, that
 can be automatically launched alongside your world to perform
 several periodic automatic functions, such as checking that your
 server is still running, issuing the save command to the server,
 creating backup archives (tar.gz), and generating maps.

the script relies upon as few dependencies as possible, but there
 are a few. of course, running a Minecraft server requires java.
 bash is also required, which does not come by default with FreeBSD,
 and the same goes with sudo.
 GCC is also required to compile the RCON client, described
 below. if using the Minecraft-Overviewer program to generate maps,
 there are several other dependencies. check with that program's
 documentation for the necessary dependencies, some of which are
 listed in the ./distribution/doc/depends.txt file.

included in the minectl distribution is the mcrcon RCON client.
 an RCON client is required for minectl. the mcrcon client is
 currently a statically-required RCON client, although I do have
 plans to allow for any desired RCON client in the future.
 mcrcon was written by tiiffi, (NOT ME). the license and other
 information can be found in the mcrcon directory included in
 this distribution. source code for mcrcon is included with this
 distribution, as well as amd64 and i386 binaries for FreeBSD,
 compiled by me on FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE.

minectl also has support for generating maps of your worlds using the
 awesome Minecraft-Overviewer program. this program is not included
 in the minectl distribution, and the minectl configuration will
 have all use of it disabled by default. if you want to use it, you
 can check it out at <http://overviewer.org>. minectl has a explicit
 command for calling overviewer.py to generate a map for a world, as
 well as supporting periodic map generation through the minectld
 daemon.

this is my first actual release-quality program, and the creation of it
 was as much for the project as for the end result. as such, i
 would love it if i could get as much feedback as possible. this includes
 bug reports, suggestions, criticisms, and any other information about
 the general quality of the design and implementation of minectl.
 specifically, i would like feedback on better ways to implement parts
 of the script, and assessments of the general safety and security of it.
