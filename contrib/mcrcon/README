** I did not write mcrcon **
** Check the README in the src for more info **


included are binaries for i386 and amd64, compiled on FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE

if you do not want the included binaries, the source is included. the src
 directory contains the mcrcon.c file, as well as the original source archive.
 compiling mcrcon requires GCC. instructions are found in the src/COMPILING.txt file.

if you want to use the included binaries, move the appropriate binary for your 
 architecture to a directory in your $PATH, such as:

  # mv ./mcrcon_amd64 /usr/local/bin/mcrcon
or
  # mv ./mcrcon_i386  /usr/local/bin/mcrcon


** mcrcon is currently required by minectl **
