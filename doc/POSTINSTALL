 Additional configuration is probably required

  The installer did most of the work, but there may be some loose ends.

  Check out the config file, stored in $MINECTL_CONF/minectl.conf

  You will likely need to log out and back in to apply group membership
  
  minectl does not come with any Minecraft files. It is entirely up to you
   as to whether, and how, to obtain Minecraft. Put the Minecraft server
   file into the jar/ directory under the server directory

  If you plan on using the manual creation mode and don't want to use
   or don't know how to use vi, make sure to set EDITOR to another
   text editor
  
  You also need to install an rcon client. minectl was designed to work
   with mcrcon. Source for mcrcon is included in the minectl installer
   distribution, as well as binaries for i386 and amd64 FreeBSD
  
  This distribution does not come with Overviewer, which can be used to
   generate awesome web browseable isometric maps of your worlds. Grab
   it at www.overviewer.org. Using Overviewer is resource-intensive, so
   be careful when running on small hardware. Overviewer has some
   dependencies:
	- python 2.7
	- py27-numpy
	- py27-imaging
   Then install it using 'python setup.py build'

  Use 'minectl help' for more information
